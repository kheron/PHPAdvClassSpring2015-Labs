Lets use our MVC framework to develop a site for our email Application. Please remember to remove any debugging code before submitting. 

Using the Data we will want to perform crud operations on the site. (Same as last Lab)
Use the Models and DAO's to access the data with services.  Add other services you might need for the site.
Create a controller for each view page.
All Classes must be documented with proper comments.
Have links that allow me to visit the other pages.
 By the end, I should be able to perform crud with email types and emails.  Be sure to include links to the other pages

Make sure to follow MVC standards.  Keep your controllers light, your models Heavy and your view page just to display data.
